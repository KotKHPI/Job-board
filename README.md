## About Project

This is a job portal, a pretty complicated one. You will be able to take a look at all the job offers, but you can also search for different jobs by using text, which you can use to find jobs by title, by description, but also by the company name. Obviously, this is all using different models, so this means we will be making complicated queries to query on the relationships as well.
Also, for create the project, was used a library called Alpine JS, which is a minimalistic version of libraries like Vue or React.
I built a lot of blade advanced components like this breadcrumb, and then I'll reuse those card components and card job component that displays the basic info about a job in all places.
You can sign in, and you've got some more interesting possibilities you can apply to jobs and send your CV.
And you can also be an employer.
